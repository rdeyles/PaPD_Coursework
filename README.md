**Project Title:** Interactive Kotlin Command-Line Utility 

**Objective:** Develop a Kotlin-based command-line application that processes user inputs to perform specific calculations and conversions. The application will help students apply procedural programming concepts and implement control flow, data handling, and user input validation using Kotlin. 

**Requirements:** 

1. Command Handling:
  * Implement a single function to interpret and execute commands interactively.
  * Commands to implement (for processing every command a separate function should be implemented):
    * sum: Calculates $(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + … + 𝑛^3)$, where n is a natural number.
    * conversion: Converts a given temperature from one unit to Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit.
    * factorial: Calculates the sum of the factorials of three given integers $𝑛_1, 𝑛_2 \text{ and } 𝑛_3$.
2. Input Validation:
  - Validate user inputs to ensure they are appropriate for the requested calculations.
  - Provide meaningful error messages if inputs are invalid or out of the expected range.
3. User Interaction:
  - The application must interactively request and retrieve input from the console.
  - Display results or error messages back to the user in a clear and understandable format.
4. Documentation and Reporting:
  - Document the project design and implementation in a detailed report.
  - Include roles and contributions of each team member in implementation and documentation.
  - Provide the complete Kotlin code and explain the logic and functionality.
  - Create a flowchart diagram to visually represent the algorithm.
  - Include screenshots of the code within the IntelliJ IDEA environment to demonstrate the development and testing stages.
